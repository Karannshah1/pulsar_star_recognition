Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission beam which is detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter, testing general relativity, gravitational wave and a lot more. As pulsars rotate, their emission beam moves across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, which produces a detectable pattern. As pulsars rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes. Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label and classify pulsar candidates for rapid analysis. Classification of the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. In this paper, we have described the process of our data operations on the Kaggle Predicting-Pulsar star data-set, and various models are been trained on the transformed data-set in which SVM is most performs best with an accuracy of 97.9% on test data.
